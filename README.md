# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), a famous game.
Implemented in React.

You can play against another player by alternating who gets to use the mouse,
or you can play against a bot. The bot functionality is currently under development,
so you will have to manually turn it on every time you start a new game, and you
should use the toggle AI button on an empty board.
